# Heart Disease Prediction ML Model

## Description

This project is a comprehensive heart disease prediction system built using machine learning algorithms. The system enables users to assess their risk of developing heart disease through an interactive user interface.

### Key Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: A robust ML model trained and tested on heart disease datasets using advanced machine learning algorithms
- **Data-Driven Predictions**: The model analyzes various health parameters to predict the likelihood of heart disease
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive UI that allows users to input their health metrics and receive instant predictions about their chances of developing heart disease
- **Accurate Results**: The model is thoroughly trained and tested to provide reliable predictions

### How It Works

1. **Training Phase**: The ML model is trained on a comprehensive heart disease dataset containing various patient health parameters
2. **Testing & Validation**: The model is rigorously tested to ensure accuracy and reliability
3. **User Interaction**: Users can input their health information through the web interface
4. **Prediction**: The system processes the input data and provides predictions about heart disease risk

This tool is designed to help individuals understand their heart health status and make informed decisions about seeking medical consultation.
