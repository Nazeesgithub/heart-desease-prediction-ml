# Heart Disease Prediction ML Model

## Description

This project implements a comprehensive heart disease prediction machine learning model. The system is designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health parameters and medical indicators.

### Key Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: A trained ML model that predicts heart disease risk
- **Dataset Training & Testing**: The dataset is thoroughly trained and tested using advanced machine learning algorithms to ensure accurate predictions
- **User Interface**: An interactive UI that allows users to input their health parameters and check their chances of getting heart disease
- **Real-time Predictions**: Users can receive instant predictions about their heart disease risk based on the trained model

### How It Works

1. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing various health metrics and indicators
2. Machine learning algorithms process and learn patterns from the training data
3. The model is tested and validated to ensure prediction accuracy
4. Users can access the UI to input their health parameters
5. The system provides predictions about the likelihood of heart disease

This tool aims to provide an accessible way for individuals to assess their heart disease risk and potentially seek early medical intervention.
